We often need to import a module/method from a sibling package.
In this case intra-package references are used.
for eg. here we have created a customer package from which we will try to import contact module into sales.

we can use Absolute-import or Relative-import:

Absolute: (PREFERRED)
from ecommerce.customer import contact

Relative:
from ..customer import contact

one dot - current package
another dot - inside current package
