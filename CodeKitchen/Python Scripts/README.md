# Python Scripts
These are the Python Scripts I had written during learning and hands-on Practice. I think Scripts are very basic and easy to understand along with comments provided, however some basic programming familiairty might be necessary. These scripts are meant for a quick-revisit or introduction to python.

Python Version used in Scripts : Python 3.7.3
Operating System : Windows 10

## Instructions:
I have written comments for better understanding and revision of the topics, however for more depth regarding any coding construct,
Python Documentation is the best source.I have numbered the Folders and Files so that there is a proper flow in concepts. For now you may focus on topics 1-6, as I will update remaining soon.

### IDE:
Although there are many good options out there, I will recommend using "VisualStudioCode" , it has become my most favourite IDE to work with since it has advantages of both, Lightness and swiftness of SublimeText and power,usefulness of Microsoft-Visual studio.

## Source:
Also, I would like to share the source where I learned Python from,

https://codewithmosh.com/

I really recommend this site for learning Python (and many other courses). 
Mosh ("the instructor") has done the best job at teaching and demonstrating in a fluent and simple way and has taught all the things you will need to feel confident and get started with Python. You can also checkout his youtube channel below.
