# Python Scripts
These are the Python Scripts I had written during Practice.

## Instructions:
I have written comments for better understanding and revision of the topics, however for more depth regarding any coding construct,
Python Documentation is the best source.I have numbered the Folders and Files so that there is a proper flow in concepts. For now you may focus on topics 1-6, as I will update remaining soon.

## Source:
Also, I would like to share the source where I learned Python from,
```
Link : https://codewithmosh.com/
```
I really recommend this site for learning Python (and many other courses). 
Mosh ("the instructor") has done the best job at teaching and demonstrating in a fluent and simple way and has taught all the things you will need to feel confident and get started with Python.
