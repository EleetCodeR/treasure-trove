# Python Scripts
These are the Python Scripts I had written during learning and hands-on Practice. I think Scripts are very basic and easy to understand along with comments provided, however some basic programming familiarity might be necessary. These scripts are meant for a quick-revisit to Python.

Python Version used in Scripts : Python 3.7.3.

Operating System : Windows 10.

## Instructions:
I have written comments for better understanding and revision of the topics, however for more depth regarding any coding construct, Python Documentation is the best source. I have numbered the files and folders so that there is a proper flow in concepts.

For now you may focus on topics 1-4 first, then follow this order:

1. Go to app.py and read section numbered 50,
2. file named 51_CompiledFiles.md,
3. Go to app.py and read section numbered 52,
4. file named 53_Intra_PackageRef.md,
5. file named 54_dirFunction.py,
6. file named 55_executeModule.md and NOTE in app.py,

then continue with 6th topic, I will be adding more topics soon.

### IDE:
Although there are many good options out there, I will recommend using "VisualStudioCode" , it has become my most favourite IDE to work with since it has advantages of both, Lightness and swiftness of SublimeText and power,usefulness of Microsoft-Visual studio.

## Source:
Also, I would like to share the source where I learned Python from,

https://codewithmosh.com/

I really recommend this site for learning Python (and many other courses). 

Mosh ("the instructor") has done the best job at teaching and demonstrating in a fluent and simple way and has taught all the things you will need to feel confident and get started with Python. You can also checkout his youtube channel below.
