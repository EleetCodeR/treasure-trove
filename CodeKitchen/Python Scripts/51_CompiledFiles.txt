# Module-Loading:

When we execute/run the code a new folder is created by the python-compiler called : "__pycache__"
This folder containes compiled files in the below format:
<filename>dot<implementation of python used for compilation>.pyc
<filename>.cpython-37.pyc

The python compiler stores compiled files in this folder as they can we used directly when "importing/loading" is needed
and need not be re-compiled. hence due to this "module-loading" happens faster.


# But How does compiler understand that these compiled files are upto date or not?
for this, compiler compares the date-time of source code file/s and the compiled file/s , 
if it matched then compiled files is upto date.

# These files are in binary format
# Main module file (app.py)/ entry-point  is always compiled.
