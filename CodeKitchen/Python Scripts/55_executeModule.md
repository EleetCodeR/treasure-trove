# EXECUTE MODULE AS SCRIPT:
In sales.py module we have already defined 2 functions.

we can define any statements in this module and these statements will be executed the first time this module is loaded. so if we import this module into few different modules of our program, python will execute it only once and then cache it in memory.

so statements written in that module will only be executed once.

See  EXECUTING MODULE AS SCRIPT section in sales.py file.
